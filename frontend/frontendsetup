# Campus Compass Frontend

React + TypeScript + Vite project for the UF Campus Compass login and navigation app.


- If `npm run dev` doesn't work, make sure to run `npm install` first. If that still doesn't work, ensure Node.js is installed.
- The `css` folder contains files that define the styling of the frontend.

- `Login.tsx` contains the login page component, which is where `connection` logic to the backend API should be implemented.

- `App.tsx` is the root component that renders the login page.
- `main.tsx` bootstraps the React app and applies global styles.

- the .json files are just for react and vite setup, no need to change i believe
- assets folder is if you want to add images to be used on the frontend
